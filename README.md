Created a webpage using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. In the left side I have added a blur background, so that the text looks very clear.

On the right side we have some small images and one image is big. So that one image is active and the same image is applied in the background.

If I click on Next or Previous Icon, Then It will change the Active image and It will also change the background image on the website.
